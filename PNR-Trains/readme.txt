This is the PNR Trains NewGRF for OpenTTD written in NML. 



----------------------
2 Usage and Parameters
----------------------

There are currently no special parameters included with the GRF.

----------------------
2.1 Usage Notes
----------------------

The trains are built to run on narrow guage tracks. It is highly recommended to use a NewGRF that provides 
narrow guage railtypes. We recommend the Japan Set Tracks and set the Mode from the parmeters to international.
